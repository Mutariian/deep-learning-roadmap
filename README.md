# Deep Learning Roadmap

This repository documents my progress through weekly deep learning projects and experiments.
 📘 Structure
-week1/ – Introduction to neural networks and data preprocessing  
- week2/ – Building and training custom models  
- week3/ – Training with TensorFlow and saving models  
- models/ – Saved trained models for reuse

🧠 Week 3 Highlights
- Built and trained a simple neural network on the MNIST dataset.
- Saved model weights (`mnist_model.h5`) for future inference.
